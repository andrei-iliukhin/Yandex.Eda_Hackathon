Main Task:

Optimize the algorithm for the food delivery service.
From the data, estimate what proportion of the sample orders could be delivered using multiorders in all cities where restaurants are located?

There is an unknown algorithm for combining orders and the result of its work on a sample of restaurants A. In the problem, we need to predict the behavior of the algorithm on a sample of restaurants B.


Key metric:

share of multi-orders = number of orders that were delivered together with others / total number of orders
